Licensed under AGPL, this is a *Full-Stack React Native App üì±* working in conjunction with a *Django Serverüíª (Django Rest Framework)*

It is coded with the ‚ö°Ô∏èbest practices‚ö°Ô∏è in mind:

- ‚úÖSafe **Typescript Codebase**
- ‚úÖImmutable safe state with Redux
- ‚úÖJWT Code Authentication with **AWS Cognito**
- ‚úÖAirBnB ESLint Configuration
- ‚úÖError tracking with Sentry
- ‚úÖOrganized **MVC REST API architecture** with Django Rest Framework
- And more...

# Architecture
The architecture was designed by me and utilizes **AWS as the main cloud provider.**

- Authentication: **AWS Cognito** with *custom code to verify API authorization*.
  - Email Confirmation: **AWS Lamda Functions**
- File Storage: **AWS S3** utilizing Boto3 library.
- Hosting: **AWS EC2**
- Frontend: **React Native (Typescript)**
- Backend: **Django REST Framework (Python)**
